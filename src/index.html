                  Choosing who you will ask for feedback from is possibly the
                  most important part of the Vibe 360 feedback process and
                  should be given some time and attention prior to completing
                  the survey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two types of respondents Laws of Attraction ask for
                  feedback when completing a Vibe 360 survey – those who give
                  observational feedback and those who give reputational
                  feedback:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Observation feedback is from a respondent that has ‘seen you
                    do it’. This is typically your line manager and direct
                    report group.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Reputational or perception feedback is from a respondent
                    that might say ‘I think you should do that’. They are basing
                    their answer on their perception of you or what they have
                    observed from a distance.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <div class="main-heading">
                <h2>HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR RESPONDENTS</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  We collect feedback from 6 groups of people. Line Manager is
                  one person. Each of the remaining respondent groups need a
                  minimum of 5 people, however you can have up to 8 in each
                  group. This ensures that anonymity is kept in each of the
                  groups delivered in your personal report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of the groups aside from ‘Others’ are compulsory, this
                  ensures diverse and well-rounded feedback is collected which
                  is integral to the Vibe 360 report.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Self:</strong> This is you</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Line Manager:</strong> This is your immediate line
                  manager. If you report into two managers, or have a dotted
                  line into another, choose the manager who is the most
                  appropriate to give you feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Direct Reports:</strong> These are the people who
                  report into you. If you don’t have five team members that
                  report into you, choose other people that operate at a similar
                  level that you work with, or maybe other people in your team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Peers:</strong> This group is for your peers. People
                  at a similar level in the business that work alongside you on
                  a daily/weekly basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Peers 2:</strong> This respondent group is for peers
                  who work outside your function or area of business. It’s
                  important that this group reaches out to those people that
                  span a cross section of the business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Others:</strong> The ‘others’ section is optional.
                  This section can be for whoever you wish. Some examples would
                  be stakeholders, customers, suppliers or more senior people in
                  the business, or a project group you’ve recently worked with.
                  As long as the people you ask for feedback from makes sense
                  you can be as diverse as you like in this group.

                <h2>GOLDEN RULES FOR CHOOSING YOUR RESPONDENTS</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  Don’t just choose your mates... You may get a glowing report
                  but it won’t really give you a balanced view that can help you
                  develop and grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Don’t just choose people you don’t get along with. Focusing on
                  all the people you may not have seen eye to eye with recently
                  will not be beneficial as it will be too one sided. However,
                  it is a good idea to ask some of your colleagues that have a
                  different working style to you so that you can get a balanced
                  opinion of both your strengths and your development areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Choose people with whom you have a relationship with... Lots
                  of people use Vibe 360 as an opportunity to ask some of the
                  senior people in the business for feedback. Whilst this can be
                  useful (asking your bosses boss for example) asking the CEO
                  whom you’ve met once might not be that useful in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When grouping the feedback one thing to remember is that the
                  group has to ‘make sense’. Therefore, it’s not a good idea to
                  ask a very junior person in your team that has been in the
                  business for 3 months in the same section as three very senior
                  people that you’ve worked with for 10 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Choosing your respondents wisely means that you will get a
                  better quality report.
